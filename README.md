# Project_Predictive_Analytics_R

This was part of my course work for UNSW Master of Analytics in Predictive Analytics using R.


Three prediction models are proposed to predict the likelihood of whether staff will leave the company or not.

Based on the prediction model results, overtime is one of key factor in causing staff to leave.  Company needs to figure out ways to reduce overtime so that this factor can be reduced.

Furthermore, company need to look into why the younger group of staffs (<22 years old, less than 4 years in company or less than 1 year with current manager) are leaving.  Find out what the company can do to reduce attrition among this group.

Finally, employees in the job role of Sales Representative, Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive need special attention as more staff are leaving from these roles.  Find out what are the triggers.  Is it overtime, business travel, job satisfaction, work environment, job involvement, salary, or work life balance?  Then find ways to rectify the situation.

By addressing these three areas, Globex Pharma should be able to reduce the attrition to an acceptable level of 10% or less.
